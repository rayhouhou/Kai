# Kai: RAG Implementation for Policies and Procedures

This document outlines how Kai implements Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to manage and apply policies and procedures in the Know Your Customer (KYC) process. It highlights the benefits of this approach and demonstrates how it allows for consistent policy application and easy testing of rule changes.

## 1. RAG Overview in Kai

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by providing them with relevant external knowledge. In Kai, RAG is used to incorporate specific policies and procedures into the KYC decision-making process.

### Key Benefits of RAG in Kai:
1. Ensures up-to-date policy application
2. Provides consistency across different cases
3. Allows for easy updates to policies without retraining the entire model
4. Enables transparent decision-making processes
5. Facilitates testing and demonstration of policy changes

## 2. Policies and Procedures Implemented

Kai's RAG system incorporates the following key policies and procedures:

1. **Customer Acceptance Policy**
2. **Risk Classification Framework**
3. **Customer Due Diligence (CDD) Procedures**
4. **Negative News Screening Policy**
5. **Sanctions and PEP Screening Policy**

### 2.1 Customer Acceptance Policy
This policy defines:
- Eligible customer types
- Prohibited customer types
- High-risk categories requiring executive approval
- Geographical restrictions

### 2.2 Risk Classification Framework
This framework outlines:
- Client risk factors
- Geographical risk factors
- Product risk factors
- Overall risk calculation methodology

### 2.3 Customer Due Diligence (CDD) Procedures
These procedures cover:
- Standard due diligence requirements
- Enhanced due diligence triggers
- Ongoing due diligence frequencies
- Triggers for ad-hoc reviews

### 2.4 Negative News Screening Policy
This policy includes:
- Screening frequencies
- Evaluation criteria for negative news
- Screening sources and process
- False positive handling

### 2.5 Sanctions and PEP Screening Policy
This policy details:
- Screening requirements and frequency
- Match handling procedures
- False positive management
- Reporting and recordkeeping requirements

## 3. Influence on KYC Process

The RAG-implemented policies and procedures influence various stages of the KYC process:

1. **Initial Client Acceptance**: 
   - Determines if a client is eligible based on company type and geography
   - Flags high-risk categories for executive approval

2. **Risk Assessment**:
   - Calculates initial risk scores based on client, geographical, and product factors
   - Determines the level of due diligence required

3. **Due Diligence**:
   - Guides the collection of necessary documents and information
   - Triggers enhanced due diligence when required

4. **Screening**:
   - Determines frequency and depth of negative news, sanctions, and PEP screenings
   - Guides the evaluation and handling of potential matches

5. **Ongoing Monitoring**:
   - Sets the frequency of regular reviews based on risk level
   - Identifies triggers for ad-hoc reviews

## 4. Benefits of RAG Implementation

### 4.1 Consistent Policy Application
- Ensures all decisions are based on the most current policies
- Eliminates human error in policy interpretation
- Provides uniform treatment of similar cases

### 4.2 Flexibility and Adaptability
- Allows for quick updates to policies without system overhaul
- Enables easy addition of new rules or modification of existing ones

### 4.3 Transparency and Explainability
- Provides clear rationale for decisions based on specific policies
- Allows for easy auditing of decision-making processes

### 4.4 Efficient Testing and Simulation
- Facilitates quick testing of policy changes on historical or hypothetical cases
- Enables "what-if" scenarios to assess potential impact of rule changes

## 5. Demonstrating Policy Changes in UI

Kai's user interface allows compliance officers and managers to test and visualize the impact of policy changes:

1. **Rule Editor**: 
   - Users can modify existing rules or create new ones
   - Changes are immediately reflected in the RAG system

2. **Test Scenario Generator**:
   - Users can create or select test scenarios
   - Scenarios can be based on historical data or hypothetical cases

3. **Impact Visualization**:
   - The system processes test scenarios with both old and new rules
   - Results are displayed side-by-side, highlighting differences in outcomes

4. **Case-Specific Testing**:
   - Users can select a specific case and apply rule changes
   - The system shows how the changes would affect the case's risk assessment, required due diligence, or final decision

5. **Batch Testing**:
   - Users can run multiple scenarios to assess broader impact
   - Results are summarized to show overall effects (e.g., change in risk distribution, number of cases requiring enhanced due diligence)

## 6. Example: Testing a Policy Change

Let's walk through an example of testing a policy change in Kai:

1. **Current Policy**: Companies in the online gambling industry are automatically classified as high-risk.

2. **Proposed Change**: Differentiate between regulated and unregulated online gambling companies, with regulated companies classified as medium-risk.

3. **Test Process**:
   a. User modifies the risk classification rule in the UI
   b. User selects a set of historical online gambling company cases
   c. Kai processes these cases with both old and new rules
   d. UI displays results showing:
      - Number of companies reclassified from high to medium risk
      - Changes in required due diligence measures
      - Potential impact on ongoing monitoring frequency

4. **Decision Making**:
   Based on the test results, compliance officers can make an informed decision about whether to implement the policy change.

## Conclusion

Kai's implementation of RAG for policies and procedures provides a powerful, flexible, and transparent system for managing KYC processes. By allowing for easy updates and testing of policies, Kai ensures that financial institutions can adapt quickly to changing regulations while maintaining consistency and efficiency in their KYC operations.
